School District Analysis

Using Pythondata, panda and Numpy libraries, I analyze a sample of data about schools in the area. The data had been recorded and collected to demonstrate the student demographic, their school along with math and reading scores. The data are located in two csv files (students_complete.csv and schools_complete.csv).   

During the initial analysis while calculating the passing average score for math and reading for each school. It appears that Thomas High school has the highest passing percentage in reading comparing with other schools when Bailey high school came in the first place in math.
After further analysis, when comparing math and reading passing score percentage for all schools and run it against the overall passing percentage, I observe that even though Thomas High School came in the first place in the initial analysis as we investigate further Thomas High School came in the last five ranking meanwhile Cabrera High School came in the first place. Also the top 7 schools were charter school and the bottom five school were district school. 
Here is a breakdown for each school, as it demonstrates that the school with highest budget, the overall passing rate is % 54.64 for district school. Meanwhile charter schools resides on the highest level of academic achieving with lower budget spend
